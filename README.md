<hr>

Welcome to my **90 Days of DevOps** repository! This repository serves as a public log and showcase of my learning journey through the [90 Days of DevOps ](https://90daysdevops.295devops.com/) program created by [Rossana Suarez (roxsross)](https://github.com/roxsross).

Here, you'll find notes, code examples, scripts, configurations, and projects developed as I progress through the daily modules of this comprehensive DevOps curriculum.

## üåü About the 90 Days of DevOps Program

The [90 Days of DevOps](https://90daysdevops.295devops.com/) is an intensive program designed to equip individuals with practical skills and knowledge across various DevOps domains. It covers a wide range of topics, including:

- **Linux Fundamentals**
- **Version Control (Git)**

- **CI/CD Pipelines**
- **Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)**
- **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible)**
- **Monitoring & Logging**
- **Networking & Security**
- And much more!

My goal with this repository is to:

- Document my understanding of each topic.
- Share practical implementations and solutions.
- Track my personal growth and learning milestones.
- Provide a resource for others embarking on a similar journey.
